# RandomSort

RandomSort is a terrible idea. It attempts, and I do mean "attempts", to sort an array by randomly re-arranging elements until it finds the right combination to create an ordered list. At its best it will succeed in this task. At its worst it will never finish. You should never use this for anything serious.

This was created as a joke and should be used as such.
